# agents.lib.sh — THE capability-tier resolver. One implementation, many callers.
#
# Answers exactly one question: "which execution model does this tier run on?"
#
#   sh scripts/agents.lib.sh implementer          -> prints the mapped model id,
#                                                    or nothing if it is unmapped
#   sh scripts/agents.lib.sh implementer content  -> the same, for work whose
#                                                    MEDIUM has its own mapping
#   . scripts/agents.lib.sh; resolve_tier …       -> either, as a shell function
#
# Sourcing is side-effect-free in every shell, including zsh (see the bottom of
# the file). A sourcing caller must say where the config lives, though, because
# a sourced file cannot portably learn its own path:
#
#   AGENTS_CONFIG=scripts/agents.config.sh; . scripts/agents.lib.sh  # explicit
#   _agents_here=scripts; . scripts/agents.lib.sh                    # or by dir
#
# Two statements on purpose: a prefix assignment on `.` persists only in plain
# sh — bash and zsh drop it before the sourced code runs, and the recipe would
# quietly resolve UNMAPPED.
#
# With neither set, orders 2 and 3 below are both skipped and every tier reports
# UNMAPPED — deliberately, since the only other candidate is whatever repository
# the process happens to be standing in (see agents_load_config).
#
# WHY THE KIT NEVER NAMES A MODEL
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Model identifiers rot faster than any other constant a framework could carry:
# they are renamed, deprecated and repriced on someone else's schedule, and they
# differ per provider and per agent harness. A kit that shipped one would be
# shipping a lie with a timer on it, and the lie would be re-read by every
# session that loads the manual.
#
# So the kit ships the VOCABULARY and the MECHANISM, and your project supplies
# the mapping:
#
#   VOCABULARY   four tier names — planner, implementer, mechanical, reviewer —
#                defined in the manual layer (the root manual and the local
#                workflow article), because deciding which tier a piece of work
#                deserves is a human process rule, not a script's business.
#                Plus an OPEN second axis, the task DOMAIN, below.
#   MECHANISM    this file. Shared layer (see VERSION): copied verbatim, so a
#                fix to the resolution order reaches every project.
#   MAPPING      scripts/agents.config.sh. Yours, local, never overwritten by a
#                kit update — the same split, and the same reasoning, as
#                guards.lib.sh / guards.config.sh.
#
# THE UNCONFIGURED DEFAULT IS LOAD-BEARING
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# An unmapped tier prints NOTHING and exits 0, after warning once. "Nothing" is
# a real answer: the caller passes no model parameter and the spawned agent
# inherits the session's own model, which is precisely the behaviour every
# project has today. A resolver that hard-failed on an unmapped tier would make
# a freshly bootstrapped project unable to spawn anything, and would be deleted
# on day one — and a deleted resolver resolves nothing.
#
# An UNKNOWN tier is the opposite case and does fail (exit 2). A typo is not a
# policy choice: silently running `implementor` on whatever the session happens
# to be is the exact cost blindness this seam exists to remove.
#
# THE SECOND AXIS: TASK DOMAIN
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A tier says how much JUDGEMENT the work is worth. It says nothing about what
# the work is made of — and "write the launch announcement" and "write the retry
# logic" are the same cost/benefit shape while being different enough that a
# project may well want different models on them. One axis cannot express that,
# so there is an optional second one: the DOMAIN, the medium of the work.
#
#   AGENT_TIER_IMPLEMENTER_CONTENT   set  -> `resolve_tier implementer content`
#   AGENT_TIER_IMPLEMENTER           set  -> everything else at that tier
#
# The two vocabularies are deliberately OPPOSITE, and the difference is the
# whole design:
#
#   TIER   CLOSED. Four names, fixed by the manual layer, shared word between a
#          ticket, a skill and this file. An unknown one is a caller bug.
#   DOMAIN OPEN. Whatever tokens a project finds worth distinguishing — `code`,
#          `content`, `sql`, `html-report`. It is pure local policy, invented in
#          the config and the tickets, so this file cannot hold a list of them
#          and does not try. An UNMAPPED domain is therefore a working state,
#          not a typo: it falls back to the plain tier mapping in silence,
#          because "no special opinion about this medium" is the ordinary case
#          and a warning for it would train people to ignore the one that
#          matters.
#
# What the domain does NOT get is a free pass on its SHAPE. It is interpolated
# into a variable name and expanded through `eval`, and unlike the tier it was
# never whitelisted against a fixed list — so the shape check IS its whitelist:
# `[a-z][a-z0-9-]*` and nothing else, checked before the token is allowed
# anywhere near the eval. Hyphens are legal in a token and illegal in a shell
# variable name, so they fold to underscores: `html-report` reads
# AGENT_TIER_<TIER>_HTML_REPORT.
#
# Omit the argument entirely and this file behaves exactly as it did before the
# axis existed — which is the point, because every caller that predates it (the
# skills, the adapter note, a consumer's own script) keeps working untouched.
#
# Config resolution order, first hit wins:
#   1. $AGENTS_CONFIG        — explicit. If it is set and does not exist, that
#                              is an ERROR (exit 2): the caller named a file, so
#                              falling back silently would run a mapping nobody
#                              asked for. Tests rely on this.
#   2. <root of the repo THIS FILE lives in>/scripts/agents.config.sh
#   3. <this file's directory>/agents.config.sh
#
# Orders 2 and 3 are anchored on this file, never on the caller's working
# directory: a config is sourced, and sourcing one out of whatever repo an
# operator happens to be standing in would execute a stranger's code.
#
# Variable resolution order, first NON-EMPTY hit wins:
#   1. AGENT_TIER_<TIER>_<DOMAIN>   only when a domain was given
#   2. AGENT_TIER_<TIER>
#
# Exit codes:  0 resolved (a value, or deliberately nothing) · 2 usage error,
#              unknown tier, malformed domain, or an explicit config that does
#              not exist.

# The closed vocabulary — planner, implementer, mechanical, reviewer — is
# deliberately NOT configurable: the tier names are the shared word between a
# ticket, a skill and this resolver, and a project that renamed them would
# break every skill that says "implementer" while the docs gate stayed green.
# Add a MAPPING in the config; do not add a tier.
#
# There is deliberately NO variable holding that list any more. It used to be
# a module global feeding the usage and error text, and a sourced config could
# reassign it — leaving diagnostics that named tiers that do not exist while
# the literal `case` check kept working. The messages now spell the four names
# where they are printed, under the same keep-in-sync-by-hand contract as
# AGENT_DOMAIN_SHAPE's case pattern below: three literal sites (the check, the
# usage text, the unknown-tier error), moved together or not at all.

# The domain has no list here on purpose — see THE SECOND AXIS above. What it
# has instead is a SHAPE, and this is it, written once so the usage text and
# the error text below cannot drift apart. It does NOT also drive the case
# pattern that enforces the shape — that pattern spells out the alphabet
# instead of quoting this string, for the locale reason documented where it
# lives. So this string and that pattern CAN drift; keep them in sync by hand.
AGENT_DOMAIN_SHAPE='[a-z][a-z0-9-]*'

# MODULE GLOBALS, and why they diverge from guards.lib.sh's convention.
#
# guards.lib.sh takes its "directory of the calling script" as a PARAMETER,
# because it is only ever sourced by a script that knows where it lives. This
# file is also EXECUTED directly (`sh scripts/agents.lib.sh implementer` — the
# seam an agent following a SKILL.md actually uses), and in that case the only
# thing that knows the directory is `$0`, which is read at the bottom of the
# file, long after resolve_tier's signature is fixed at one argument: the tier.
# Threading the directory through as a second parameter would put a value the
# CALLER cannot supply into the caller's hands. So it is a global, set once by
# the direct-execution branch, and settable by a sourcing caller — which is the
# only way such a caller gets orders 2 and 3 at all.
#
# It defaults to EMPTY, and that is deliberate rather than tidy: it used to
# default to `.`, which quietly made resolution order 3 mean "a config file in
# whatever directory the process is standing in" — a different and much wider
# rule than the one documented above, and the same trust problem order 2 had.
# Empty means orders 2 and 3 are both skipped, so a sourcing caller that has
# not said where it is gets $AGENTS_CONFIG or nothing.
#
# The other two globals are per-process memos: config loading and the unmapped
# warning both have to happen at most once no matter how many tiers a single
# process resolves.
