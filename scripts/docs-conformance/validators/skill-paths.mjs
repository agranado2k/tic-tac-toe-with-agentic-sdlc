// Skill INTERIORS join the gate: every repo-path a skill body names is a file
// an agent will be told to open, so a dead one is a standing instruction into
// a wall. The manual layer has been held to this since the gate existed; this
// validator extends the same rule to `SKILL.md` and the sidecar markdown
// beside it.
//
// Findings here are WARNINGS, the same posture as the skill-web advisory —
// and that was a discovery, not the plan. The PRD ordered violations ("a dead
// path in an installed skill has no legitimate reading"), and implementation
// promptly found the legitimate reading: VERSION SKEW. Part 2 of the update
// recipe is manual and per-category, so a consumer mid-update — or one who
// took skills without the article a later release adds — holds skills that
// reference files that have not arrived yet, and the recipe itself requires a
// GREEN gate before an update begins. The kit's own recipe demo models
// exactly these states. A red gate would make the sanctioned starting state
// of every update illegal; a warning names the skew and lets the update
// proceed to fix it.
//
// Two accommodations, both policy rather than special cases:
//
//   - THE TEMPLATE FALLBACK. Skills ship unstamped and must read correctly on
//     both sides of bootstrap: `constitution/local-workflow.md` is a real file
//     in a consumer and only a `.template` in the kit. A token resolves if the
//     file exists OR its `.template` source does — one rule, no kit-only carve-out.
//   - EXEMPTIONS in the consumer-owned config, two shapes, each entry with a
//     reason: `skillPaths.exemptFiles` skips a whole file (for upstream-verbatim
//     documents this repo may not edit), and `skillPaths.exemptTokens` skips an
//     exact path that is legitimately absent until something creates it (a
//     report directory the skill's first run makes; a workflow bootstrap
//     installs from the templates tree).
//
// The grammar is claude-md-refs' own, imported: pathTokenRe over the SAME
// pathRoots the manual validator reads, and the same code-span/fence rules —
// one definition of "what is a path reference", now three consumers.
