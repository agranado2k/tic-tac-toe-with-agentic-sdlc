// Local vocabulary — the words that must NOT appear in the shared layer.
//
// `bootstrap.sh` stamps this template into `local-vocabulary.mjs`, seeding it
// with your project name. `config.mjs` picks that file up if it exists and
// turns each entry into a portability deny-list rule, so the very first thing
// the guard protects you from is your own product name leaking into the file
// whose only job is to be copyable.
//
// This file stays a `.template` in the kit itself: the kit has no product, and
// an empty local list is the correct reading of that.
//
// Each entry is data, not a regex — terms are escaped for you, matched
// case-insensitively on word boundaries, across the whole file (prose included,
// because names leak in sentences, not in code spans).
//
//   { id, terms: [...], reason }
//
// `reason` is shown to whoever trips the rule, so write the fix, not the rule:
// say where the sentence should have gone, not that it was denied.

	//
	// A term that is also an ordinary English word (a one-word product name like
	// "Stream" or "Pulse") will fire on prose. Either accept the noise or scope
	// the term more tightly — do not delete the entry and call it clean.
