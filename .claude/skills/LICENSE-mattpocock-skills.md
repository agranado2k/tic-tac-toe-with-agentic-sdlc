# Attribution — Matt Pocock skills

Six of the skills in this directory were **copied and adapted** from
https://github.com/mattpocock/skills. The adaptation is the same in every case:
the upstream advice is universal, and the framework replaced the parts that
named one project's stack with pointers at the artifacts this kit establishes
(`constitution/`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/domain-glossary.md`, `scripts/`).

| Skill here | Upstream | What changed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `grill-me/` | `productivity/grill-me` | verbatim |
| `grill-with-docs/` | `engineering/grill-with-docs` | glossary sidecar retargeted at `docs/domain-glossary.md`; ADR sidecar rewritten for MADR |
| `tdd/` | `engineering/tdd` | project-context prelude added to `SKILL.md`; the five sidecars are verbatim |
| `diagnose/` | `engineering/diagnose` | tool names in the feedback-loop list generalised; the architectural hand-off at the end names `/improve-codebase-architecture` and the decision record it produces |
| `to-prd/` | `engineering/to-prd` | tracker/label setup replaced by the kit's autonomy-label mechanism |
| `improve-codebase-architecture/` | `engineering/improve-codebase-architecture` **+** `engineering/codebase-design` | upstream splits the vocabulary into a separate `/codebase-design` skill; this kit ships no such skill, so that skill's glossary and its `DEEPENING.md` / `DESIGN-IT-TWICE.md` are folded in here as `LANGUAGE.md`, `DEEPENING.md` and `INTERFACE-DESIGN.md`. `CONTEXT.md` → `docs/domain-glossary.md`; the illustrative `ADR-0007` → citing a record by its own id; named stand-ins and third-party services → the role they play; upstream's `HTML-REPORT.md` → `PRESENTING.md`, a rendering-agnostic contract keeping the HTML scaffold as one worked example. Added: the capability-tier resolution for the sub-agents it spawns, and the `/to-tickets` hand-off that keeps a deepening out of a feature diff |

Each of those six carries a one-line attribution note at the bottom of its own
`SKILL.md`, so the provenance survives being read out of context.

Upstream is a moving repository. The table above was re-verified against
`mattpocock/skills` on 2026-08-09, at which point the skills live under a
`skills/<category>/` prefix (`skills/engineering/…`); the category paths in this
table are kept in the shorter form the rest of the kit cites.

The upstream repository is licensed under the MIT License (verified 2026-06-03),

## The skills that are NOT Matt Pocock's

`to-tickets/`, `implement/`, `prototype/`, `pr-iterate/`, `worktree-cleanup/` and
`merge-train/` were written for the project this framework was extracted from and
carry no upstream. `review-pr/` began as an in-house reviewer command in a
private repository and was substantially rewritten here — the second axis (the
spec & behavior confirm-list, shared invariant §5) has no upstream at all.

`dogfood/` (the optional skill — see the README) has **no upstream either**, and
the check was made rather than assumed: `mattpocock/skills` was re-read on
2026-08-09 and ships no dogfooding, QA, end-to-end or browser skill of any kind.
It was generalized from an end-to-end QA command in that same extraction-source
project, whose own commit history credits the dogfooding pattern it implements
to Kieran Klaassen's publicly described verification harness. The pattern is
prior art and is credited as such; the wording here is this kit's, and the port
deliberately dropped two things the source had — the browser-only assumption,
and the repair loop.

## The skill with a different upstream

`explain-diff/` is **copied and adapted** from Geoffrey Litt's
`explain-diff-html` skill, published as a
[public gist](https://gist.github.com/geoffreylitt/a29df1b5f9865506e8952488eac3d524)
and shared for adoption in his post
["Understanding is the new bottleneck"](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2026/07/02/understanding-is-the-new-bottleneck)
(2026-07-02). The gist declares no licence; the attribution here, plus the
note at the skill's own foot, records the provenance as accurately as the
source allows. The sections (Background / Intuition / Code / Quiz) and the
HTML format rules are his, near-verbatim. What this kit changed follows the
same pattern as the six above — one project's specifics replaced by the kit's
artifacts: a branch scope lock in the style of `/review-pr`, grounding in
`docs/domain-glossary.md` and `docs/adr/`, quiz answer-position randomization
(a fix the gist's own comment thread surfaced), an explicit
explain-never-review boundary, a restatement of the agent trust boundary over
the explained material, HTML-escaping + CSP requirements for diff-derived
content, a `$TMPDIR`-resolved output location in place of the gist's bare
`/tmp`, and a secret-redaction rule for the generated page.

Its `MICROWORLDS.md` sidecar is the kit's own writing, not part of the gist:
a catalog of playable-explanation patterns whose sources are credited, with
links, in the sidecar's own footer.
