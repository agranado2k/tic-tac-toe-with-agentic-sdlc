description: Serially land a batch of green PRs through the forge's own merge API — migration-aware ordering, update-branch for stale PRs, wait for the post-merge workflows between merges, then run /worktree-cleanup. Invoke as `/merge-train` (discover all green PRs) or `/merge-train <PR#> [<PR#>…]` (explicit batch). Operator-invoked only; complements /pr-iterate, which never merges.

# /merge-train — serialized landing of a green PR batch

## What this does

Parallel worktree agents produce batches of pull requests that each go green in
isolation. Landing them is where the manual toil and the risk concentrate: the
operator clicks merge N times, each merge instantly makes the surviving PRs
stale against the base branch, and — in most projects — a merge triggers
deployment or migration workflows against a shared environment, so **order
matters**.

This skill is the operator-side merge train: it merges a batch **one PR at a
time through the forge's own API**, re-validating between merges.

**It does not weaken shared invariant §7.** That invariant says the merge action
is a human decision with a human's name on it, and `/pr-iterate`'s hard rule
"you never merge" still stands unchanged. `/merge-train` is the human decision,
made explicitly, for a named batch, at a moment the operator chose — it is
delegation of the *mechanics* after the decision, not of the decision. An agent
never starts a train on its own initiative.

Everything stays inside branch protection: the merge and update-branch calls
produce exactly what the UI button produces. Nothing is bypassed, rebased, or
force-pushed.

## Hard rules — do not break

1. **Only the operator starts a train.** Never invoke this from another skill, a
   loop, or on your own initiative.
2. **A PR boards the train only if**: all required checks are green, it is not a
   draft, and no human review requests changes. Advisory bot reviews do not
   block; a human's "changes requested" does.
3. **The merge method is whatever `constitution/local-workflow.md` says it is**,
   and the reason it says so usually involves commit signing — read the article
   before reaching for a different flag. If the operator explicitly asks for a
   squash on a given PR, its title must satisfy Conventional Commits, because
   the title becomes the commit subject.
4. **Never** use an admin override, never touch branch protection, never
   force-push, never merge locally and push.
5. **Stale PRs are updated through the forge's update-branch API only** — a
   local rebase would strip signatures, which is the usual reason a repo forbids
   rebase merges in the first place.
6. **A failed post-merge workflow stops the train dead.** If a migration or
   deploy fails on the base branch after a merge, do not merge anything else;
   escalate immediately.
7. **When in doubt, stop the train and report.** A half-landed batch in a known
   state beats a fully-landed batch in an unknown one.

## Procedure

### 1 — Assemble the batch

If the operator gave PR numbers, use exactly those (still verify each is green —
refuse red ones with a one-line reason). Otherwise discover:

```bash
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,isDraft,reviewDecision,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,headRefName
gh pr checks <N>          # per candidate — every required check green?
```

Drop: drafts, `reviewDecision == "CHANGES_REQUESTED"`, any red or pending
required check, `mergeable == "CONFLICTING"` (send those to `/pr-iterate`
instead).

### 2 — Order the batch (contract-artifact aware)

```bash
gh pr view <N> --json files --jq '.files[].path'
```

- **PRs touching a shared, ordered, single-writer artifact go first, one at a
  time.** Database migrations and their journal/lock files are the canonical
  case, but the same reasoning covers any generated index, lockfile, or numbered
  sequence. `scripts/guards.config.sh`'s `BEHAVIOR_DELTA_SURFACES` is where this
  repo lists its contract artifacts — the persistence and schema surfaces there
  are the ones to look for. Landing them early means the siblings get updated
  against the new state instead of colliding at the end.
- **Two or more PRs adding entries to the same ordered artifact in one batch →
  escalate before merging the second.** They almost certainly claim the same
  number or slot; the later one needs regenerating, not a mechanical retry.
- Everything else: first-in-first-out by ascending PR number.

### 3 — Present the plan

Before the first merge, show the ordered list (PR, title, why it's positioned
there, which carry the ordered artifacts). In auto-discovery mode, wait for the
operator's go-ahead. When the operator passed explicit PR numbers, that message
*is* the go-ahead — proceed.

### 4 — Land each PR, in order

```bash
# a. Stale against the base branch? Update through the forge.
gh pr view "$PR" --json mergeStateStatus --jq .mergeStateStatus   # BEHIND?
gh api -X PUT "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$PR/update-branch"

# b. Wait for checks to re-run and go green.
gh pr checks "$PR" --watch

# c. Merge, with the method the local workflow article mandates.
gh pr merge "$PR" --merge

# d. Wait for the post-merge workflows before the next merge — the train should
#    observe each result, not outrun it, even when their concurrency groups
#    would queue anyway.
gh run list --branch <base> --limit 5 --json name,status,conclusion,databaseId
gh run watch <databaseId>
```

**If checks go red after update-branch (4b)**: that is a real cross-PR
interaction surfaced early — skip the PR, record it as a `/pr-iterate`
candidate, continue the train.
**If the merge itself is rejected**: re-read state; if it is not a transient
(e.g. checks re-queued), stop and report.
**If a post-merge workflow fails (4d)**: hard rule 6 — stop the train, escalate
with the run log.

### 5 — After the batch

Run **`/worktree-cleanup`** — the merged PRs' worktrees are now prunable, and
the root checkout's base branch should fast-forward to include the batch.

If the batch bumped `VERSION`, the train is not over at cleanup: cut and push
the release tag (`git tag -a v<version> <merge sha> && git push origin
v<version>`) — an untagged bump is a release no consumer can reach, and a
repo whose CI enforces release integrity (the kit's own does, in its
self-host suite's F3) stays red on main by design until the tag exists.
Tagging is part of landing the bump, and it carries the operator's name
exactly like the merge did.

## Output format

```
merge-train — <date>

Plan:      #A (schema) -> #B -> #C
Landed:    #A <merge sha> · #B <merge sha>
Skipped:   #C — checks went red after update-branch (-> /pr-iterate #C)
base:      <sha before> -> <sha after> · post-merge workflows ✅
Cleanup:   <worktrees removed> removed · <kept> kept
```

## Cross-references

- `constitution/local-workflow.md` — the merge method, the rejected one and why,
  and the required checks. That article is the authority for step 4c.
- `docs/adr/INDEX.md` — if the merge method was a recorded decision, cite its
  number when you explain an ordering or a refusal.
- `/pr-iterate` — drives a PR to green; never merges.
- `/worktree-cleanup` — the final step of every train.
