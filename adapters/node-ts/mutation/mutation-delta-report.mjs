// mutation-delta-report.mjs — turn one Stryker JSON report into the lines a
// reviewer can act on.
//
// Usage: node mutation-delta-report.mjs <path-to-mutation.json>
//
// Called by mutation-delta.sh, which owns the scoping and the run; this half
// owns the SHAPE OF THE ANSWER and is therefore pure — a file in, text out, no
// git and no Stryker. That is what makes it testable without a mutation run,
// which matters: the expensive half of this diagnostic is the half you least
// want to re-run while iterating on the wording of its output.
//
// The answer has exactly two parts, because a reviewer only ever asks two
// questions: how load-bearing are the tests over the code this branch touched
// (the score), and WHICH behaviour did nothing check (the survivor list, each
// with file:line and the mutator, so it can be opened and read). Killed mutants
// are a number, never a list: they are the part that needs no attention.
//
// Input is the `mutation-testing-report-schema` v1 JSON Stryker's `json`
// reporter emits — `{ files: { <path>: { mutants: [...] } } }`. Dependency-free
// on purpose, so it runs under a bare `node` with nothing installed.

import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";

// Stryker's own score arithmetic (mutation-testing-metrics), restated here so
// this script needs no dependency on it:
//   detected = killed + timeout       undetected = survived + noCoverage
//   valid    = detected + undetected  covered    = detected + survived
// CompileError / RuntimeError mutants are INVALID (a mutant that never ran is
// evidence of nothing) and `Ignored` ones were excluded on purpose; neither
// belongs in a denominator.
//
// The undetected ones are also exactly the survivor list: a mutant nothing
// killed and a mutant nothing even ran are the same finding for a reviewer —
// "this behaviour is unenforced" — so they share a section, tagged by status.
